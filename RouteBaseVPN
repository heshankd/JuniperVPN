Objective 
---------
Configure a route-based site-to-site VPN to connect private networks on vSRX-1 (LAN1 and LAN2) and vSRX-2 (LAN1). 
We will manually configure the IKE and IPsec proposal parameters. 

# ISP Router Configuration
	interface configuration

# Firewall Pre Configuration
	interface configuraion (private n public)
	default route configuration
	zone configuration (private to public)
	security policy configuration from private zone to public zone and vice versa.

# VPN Configuration
1. Internet zone should allow isakmp traffic

2. Configure secure tunnel (st) interface

3. Add route to the remote side and make the (st) interface as the gateway

4. Add the st interface to security zone, new zone for VPN

5. Add Site1(local) LAN address to LAN zone and Site2(remote) LAN address to New VPN Zone

6. Phase 1 Configuration / IKE propposal
	authentication method (dsa-signatures, ecdsa-signatures-256, ecdsa-signatures-384, pre-shared-keys*, rsa-signatures)
	authentication-alogorithm (md5, sha-256*, sha-384, sha1)
	encryption algorithm (3des-cbc, aes-128-cbc, aes-128-gcm, aes-192-cbc, aes-192-gcm, aes-256-cbc*, aes-256-gcm, des-cbc)
	DH group (group1,2*,5,14,19,20,24)
	lifetime of the channel [in seconds - 86400*]

7. IKE policy
	mode (main*, aggressive) - IKE mode for phase1
	pre-shared-key (ascii, hexadecimal)
	proposal

8. Define IKE gateway with,
	remote side peer IP 
	IKE policy
	outgoing interface - Public Zone
	IKE version (default ?) (v1-only, v2-only)

9. Phase 2 Proposal
	IPsec protocol (ah, esp*)
	authentication algorithm (hmac-md5-96, hmac-sha-256-128*, hmac-sha1-96)
	encryption algorithm (3des-cbc, aes-128-cbc, aes-128-gcm, aes-192-cbc, aes-192-gcm, aes-256-cbc*, aes-256-gcm, des-cbc)	
	lifetime of the tunnel (in seconds)

10. Create phase 2 policy / IPsec policy
	phase 2 proposal
	DH group for PFS (group1,2*,5,14,19,20,24)

11. Define IPsec VPN
	gateway
	ipsec policy
	tunnel establish method,
  (immediately - tunnel created when configurations commited / on-traffic - tunnel created when there is traffic going through)
	bind interface  	<<< in route-base vpn it binds secure tunnel interface in IPsec VPN configuration and uses routing process to direct traffic to the tunnel interface
				<<< in policy base vpn it uses security policy to direct traffic to the tunnel interface

12. Create security policy to allow and pass traffic from LAN zone to New VPN Zone

****If tunnel is not establishing, try this****
in ike gateway configuration, configure proxy id

SRX1
====
set security ipsec vpn IPSECVPN1 ike proxy-identity local 20.20.20.2/30
set security ipsec vpn IPSECVPN1 ike proxy-identity remote 30.30.30.2/30

When only one side configured, i recieved this error message

root@Site1Firewall_root123# run show security ipsec inactive-tunnels
  Total inactive tunnels: 1
  Total inactive tunnels with establish immediately: 1

SRX2
====
set security ipsec vpn IPSECVPN1 ike proxy-identity local 30.30.30.2/30
set security ipsec vpn IPSECVPN1 ike proxy-identity remote 20.20.20.2/30

Proxy ID for
	Unstable tunnels
	traffic failing to pass on peer device due to traffic arriving on wrong VPN tunnel
	inability to establish a VPN tunnel due to "failed to match peer proxy-ids" problem


Acording to Juniper, if proxy ID works fine, below output should come for #show security ipsec security-association details
